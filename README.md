# WEATHER DASHBOARD APPLICATION

The application consists of a “Weather Dashboard” for the user to select
two favorite cities. The application searches openweathermap.org and displays
the current and hourly weather report for those cities. The user’s preferred
temperature units and the two favorite cities will be stored as preference
settings in the browser’s local storage and retrieved when the page is loaded.
